# Smart Glove for the Hearing and Speech Impaired
A wearable assistive device designed to help individuals with hearing and speech impairments communicate more effectively. This glove translates hand gestures (sign language) into readable text (and optionally speech), bridging communication gaps and improving day-to-day interactions.

## 💡 What the Project Does
This smart glove detects hand gestures using an accelerometer (ADXL 335), processes the gesture data with an Arduino 
microcontroller, and displays the corresponding message on an LED screen. The goal is to convert sign language into text, 
making communication easier for people who are hearing and speech impaired.

## 🌟 Why the Project Is Useful
- **Accessibility**: Provides a medium for the hearing and speech impaired to communicate with non-sign language users.
- **Portability**: Lightweight and wearable; can be used anywhere.
- **Affordability**: Built with easily available, low-cost components.
- **Expandability**: Can be enhanced with more sensors or speech output in future versions.

## 🚀 How to Get Started

### 1. Hardware Setup
- Collect components: Arduino Uno/Nano, ADXL 335, LED Display, switches, power supply.
- Connect them as per the circuit diagram (to be added in `/docs` or `/images` folder).

### 2. Software Setup
- Install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- Write or upload the Embedded C code for gesture detection and display.
- Upload the code to Arduino using the USB interface.

### 3. Testing
- Wear the glove and perform predefined gestures.
- Watch the text output on the LED display.
